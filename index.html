    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    Hi, I'm Michael. I'm an independent developer and computer graphics enthusiast based out of Toronto, Ontario.
    I try to keep up on the latest in 3D Graphics through my <a href="projects.html">side projects</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Previously, I worked as the Visualization Lead of the Calgary branch of a geological visualization company, <a href="http://www.seequent.com">Seequent Solutions</a>.
    For my MSc, I worked under <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van">Michiel van de Panne</a>
    on <a href="research.html">physics based character animation</a>, creating a simple scripting language to
    control the motion of a 2D humanoid character.
    </p>

    <p>
    On the side, I enjoy <a href="http://www.kneeknacker.com">trail running</a>, board gaming, playing piano, reading, climbing, and baking.
