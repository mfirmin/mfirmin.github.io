		After finishing my MSc, I joined a 3D data visualization startup, 3point Science, as the first hire.
        In March 2016, the company was acquired by <a href="http://www.seequent.com">Seequent</a> (formerly ARANZ Geo), a New Zealand based company
        which is known for the Leapfrog Geo 3D modeling software.
        Our team pioneered Leapfrog View, Seequent's cloud solution.
